# employee-performance-api
Requirements Design a web application that allows employees to submit feedback toward each other&amp;#39;s performance review. Partial solutions are acceptable. It is not necessary to submit a complete solution that implements every requirement, however it should be in working condition. Admin view  Add/remove/update/view employees  Add/update/view performance reviews  Assign employees to participate in another employee&amp;#39;s performance review Employee view  List of performance reviews requiring feedback  Submit feedback Challenge Scope  High level description of design and technologies used  Server side API (using a programming language and/or framework of your choice) o Implementation of at least 3 API calls o Most full stack web developers currently use Java or Node.js on the server(with MySQL for the database), but feel free to use other tech if you prefer  Web app o Implementation of 2-5 web pages using a modern web framework (e.g. React or Angular) that talks to server side  This should integrate with your API, but it&amp;#39;s fine to use static responses for some of it  Document all assumptions made  Complete solutions aren&amp;#39;t required, but what you do submit needs to run.
